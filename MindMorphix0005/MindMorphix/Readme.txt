🧠 **Combining AI and Web Development to Detect Brain Tumors!**

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been building a full-stack web application that lets users **upload brain MRI images** and get instant predictions on whether the image shows signs of a **glioma, meningioma, or pituitary tumor** using a trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model. 🧑‍⚕️⚡

To make this accessible and secure, I also developed a **user authentication system** using:

* ✅ **Next.js (App Router)**
* 🔐 **bcrypt** for password hashing
* 🔐 **JWT + Iron Session** for secure login
* 🗄️ **MongoDB** to store user data

🌐 On the backend, a **FastAPI server** loads and serves the deep learning model, returning predictions and class probabilities in real-time.

🧪 Tested all endpoints via Postman & browser — it’s working smoothly!

This project is a step toward building smarter, secure, and user-friendly AI tools for the healthcare space.

Next Goals:
* Deploy the app for public use
* Collaborate with medical researchers for real feedback

If you're working on healthcare + AI or looking to collaborate — let’s connect!
